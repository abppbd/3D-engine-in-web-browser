# Welcome to the 3D-engine-in-web-browser!

A small<sub>[1]</sub> project to create a 3D rendering engine in a web browser using Javascript (Oh, the pain!<sub>[2]</sub>) and html.

At first only doing wire mesh rendering, and then full polygons drawings!

  [1]: 2 months later and it doesn't seem so small anymore.</br>
  [2]: I heard that it was a pain but FUCK file reading and browsers' security. (you need to make a local servere to read files)

# How to use it?
Download it all<sub>[3]</sub> and open 3Dengine in a browser<sub>[4]</sub> and a 3D scene should apear, use z/s/q/d (azerty layout) to turn around and the 4 arrows to move around (to relative to your dirction, it's weird ik).

<sub>
  [3]: in reality you just need 3Dengine.html & app.js in the js folder, but who cares anyway? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</br>
  [4]: works on firefox & chrome for windows but not on iphone cuz files & folders don't work the same, for the rest idk)
