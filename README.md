# Welcome to the 3D-engine-in-web-browser!

A small<sub>[1]</sub> project to create a 3D rendering engine in a web browser using Javascript (Oh, the pain!<sub>[2]</sub>) and html.

At first only doing wire mesh rendering, and then full polygons drawings!

[1]: 2 months later and it doesn't seem so small anymore.</br>
[2]: I heard that it was a pain but FUCK file reading and browsers' security. (you need to make a local servere to read files)
